# Memento Mori

This is a simple project to remind you of stoic principles and to give you an overview of how much time has already passed in your life.

## Tech stack

- React.js (bootstrapped with 'create-react-app')
- [Stoic Wisdom API](https://stoic-wisdom.com/api) (for the quotes)
- Tailwindcss (for styling)
- Axios (for fetching the api)
- Craco (to customize CRA without ejecting)

## Other tools used

- Figma (for the design mockup before implementation)

You will also see any lint errors in the console.
